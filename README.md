WScore.DbGateway
================

Data Access Object, a gateway object to database storage. 

### License

### required packages:

depends on "Illuminate/database", a Laravel's database component.

Laravel has an excellent ORM called Eloquent, but
I wanted some thing more simple Data Access Object.

Also, I needed something very configurable so that I can
use it for old legacy projects.

Lots of nice ideas, such as scope, are from Laravel's code.


Installation

use composer to get it as "wscore/dbgateway". name may change.
